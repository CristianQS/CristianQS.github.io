In this post we are going to talk about my experience preparing the **Kubernetes Application Developer Certification** and talk about the things that i would like to know before facing the exam.

## Prerequisites
If we search in the **official CKAD** site on **Linux Foundation** where it informs you about the differents topics you will see in the course, if you take it, It **doesn't have any prerequisite** to make this certification.

However, **It's expected** that you are familiar with a **Linux terminal** due to you will work with the terminal for the entire exam, but don't worry about this, you will only have to know. 

In addiction, as **you are going to certificate** about a **container orquestator** as *Kubernetes*, it assumes that you have some knowledge about containers. Indeed knowing one container provider such as *Docker* or *Podman* it well be enough.
## How is the exam ?

### Room Prerequisites
You must install the PSI Secure Browser
You must have a webcam
You have to fulfill a list of requesites in your room to take the exam
You must install the PSI Secure Browser

Reach 30 minutes before your scheduled exam time, you will need that time to take a photo of your DNI, your face. Then it will assign you a guard to ensure the room fulfill the requirements they asked. you will be asked to show your room, from the floor until the ceiling, your desk, etc

In my case, i have to rotate my desk to the left due to i have a white paper with name of different cities of the world. My room was free of paintings in the wall, shelves or any forniture in the floor
