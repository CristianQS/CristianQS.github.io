In this post Im going to give you details about my experience facing the **Kubernetes Application Developer Certification**. I will attend to all the topics that I wish I had known before the exam. Hope you find it interesting and helpful.

## Prerequisites
If we search in the **official CKAD** site on **Linux Foundation**, which provides information about the different topics covered in the course, we will find that there are no prerequisites for obtaining this certification.

However, **It's expected** that you are familiar with a **Linux terminal**, as you will be working with it throughout the entire exam. But don't worry, you only need to have a basic understanding of it.

Additionally, since you will be certifying in a **container orchestrator** like Kubernetes, it is assumed that you have some knowledge about containers. In fact, being familiar with a container provider such as Docker or Podman would be sufficient.

## Exam
- There are between 15-20 performance-based tasks.
- You have 2 hours to complete the CKAD exam
- The exams are proctored remotely via streaming audio, video, and screen sharing feeds through PSI Secure Browser
- You will have the result 24 hours later from the time you complete the exam.

### Room Prerequisites
There are some requisites you must complete before starting the exam
- You must fulfill the system requirements for the PSI Secure Browser.
  - You can check it [here](https://syscheck.bridge.psiexams.com/)

- One active monitor (Dual Monitors are not allowed) and It's recommended:
  - A screen size of 15‚Äù
  - A screen resolution of 1080p

Reach 30 minutes before your scheduled exam time, you will need that time to take a photo of your identification such as your face. Then it will assign you a guard to ensure the room fulfill the requirements they asked. you will be asked to show your room, from the floor until the ceiling, your desk, etc

In my case, I have to rotate my desk to the left due to I have a white paper with names of differents cities of the world. My room was free of paintings in the wall, shelves or any forniture in the floor. I just have a desk with a

### Courses

I made the [Kubernetes for Developers (LFD259)](https://training.linuxfoundation.org/training/kubernetes-for-developers/) course and the [KodeKloud CKAD](https://kodekloud.com/courses/certified-kubernetes-application-developer-ckad/) course. Both courses will teach about the core components of Kubernetes and how to use it, but there some  differences between them.

#### Labs
For the LFD259 course you will need to create a Kubernetes Cluster, they will recommend you to create it in AWS or GCP due to the labs are tested for those enviroments. I created a local Kubernetes cluster with kind and you can complete almost all the labs. In addiction I try it with Azure, but there is some labs it doesn't work as expected.

On the other hand, KodeKloud course grants you remote lab sessions, so you don't need to create any cluster.

#### Content
Both courses has some
The KodeKloud course is more oriented to pass your certification. It has lessons related with Tips for the exam, Mocked Exams 

#### Access Time
You will have 1 year of access for the LFD259 course while if you buy the KodeKloud in the Udemy platform (with access to the labs too) you will have it forever.

In conclusion I will recommend you to adquire the KodeKloud Course, because it has more lessons and labs explaining some concepts that I miss in the LFD259. Also they give you some tips to pass the exam and test your knowledge with Mock Exams.
