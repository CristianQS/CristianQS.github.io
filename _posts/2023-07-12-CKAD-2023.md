In this post we are going to talk about my experience preparing the **Kubernetes Application Developer Certification** and talk about the things that i would like to know before facing the exam.

## Prerequisites
If we search in the **official CKAD** site on **Linux Foundation** where it informs you about the differents topics you will see in the course, if you take it, It **doesn't have any prerequisite** to make this certification.

However, **It's expected** that you are familiar with a **Linux terminal** due to you will work with the terminal for the entire exam, but don't worry about this, you will only have to know. 

In addiction, as **you are going to certificate** about a **container orquestator** as *Kubernetes*, it assumes that you have some knowledge about containers. Indeed knowing one container provider such as *Docker* or *Podman* it well be enough.
